# Organization chart
This is a small web application that helps companies to visualize their data in an organized and understandable way. Available in english and spanish.
All the user has to  do is upload a csv file that includes: month, name, id, start date, gross salary, division, area, subarea, leader id and hierarchical level of each employee. Based on this, the app will not only expose the data in a table with editable headers but also in a organization chart where the user will be able to filter the company information by month and download an image that can be printed.
